There are currently two different modules under active development: a Chrome extension 
and a python script. They work independently of each other. See each module's README for
details.

Disclaimer: 
This is an experimental project designed to relieve some of students' headaches
while using gradescope. It works by parsing the HTML from gradescope and structure
things in a more reasonable way. This project is not related to gradescope.com in any way.
